    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
      Answer: Interpreting what the user wants into needs and then understanding how to implement them is the basis of what user stories are. 
              You can distill the information critical to a programs features and design from user stories and plan the path forward.
              It asks the users what features they want, what they need to have the program to be helpful, and what the purpose of the program is.

    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  This semester how taught me a tremendous amount on how planning out my future projects and programs should go. The practice and knowledge I have gained from practicing agile thinking will travel with me and help me better plan my future endeavors.
  I really liked how the Burn-Up method approached planning and execution. It broke things down to bit-sized and achievable pieces that were not absolute so that if more features were to be added, it wouldn't require replanning all my phases of work.
  It based it's chunks by counting up to 100% completion of the project with each part adding to the percent completed rather than counting down from 100% of work left to do. This mentality helps my achievements feel more substantial and when adding
  more features the number of completions doesn't change or go back but makes the part I’m working on count a different % of completion, avoiding the feeling of lost progress.

    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  I believe that being a good team member in software development requires multiple traits. To me, these traits are having the required technical skills, being able to effectively communicate and bolster a collaborative effort from communication,
  and having a collaborative attitude. When speaking of technical skills I speak of the ability to learn and understand the subject matter of what you are working on. Not known how to program a feature is ok when starting a project, but being unable to
  learn how to is another issue entirely. Effective communication doesn't mean just being able to state wants and needs, it’s to relay understanding between members of a group, building trust, and being able to seek help in times of need.
  Collaborative attitude is the ability to work well with others, this extends outside of the quality of a deliverable. It means having team members willing and wanting to work with you and one another for the completion of the project.
  Overall, the team would be fragmented and progress on projects would be grinding to a halt with members leaving the group to go to other teams or other companies if it came to it.
